# Drama Class Web Application
This is a simple web application that helps with Drama class. It allows you to play three different audio tracks with adjustable fade-in and fade-out times.

### Getting Started
To use this application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The three audio tracks are labeled "Happy", "Sad", and "Suspense". Clicking on any of these tracks will start playing the audio with a fade-in effect, while stopping any other tracks that may be playing. When the audio track ends, it will fade out and stop automatically.

### Adjusting Fade-In and Fade-Out Times
By default, the fade-in and fade-out times are set to 1 second. However, you can adjust these values using the input fields provided on the web page. Simply type in a new value (in seconds) and press "Enter" or click outside of the input field to apply the changes.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the application, try the following:
Make sure your web browser is up-to-date.
Check that you have an active internet connection (if using any external resources).
Ensure that your audio files are in the correct format and are accessible from the same directory as the web page.
If the audio playback seems choppy or distorted, try adjusting the fade-in and fade-out times to a longer duration.
